# Weather Dashboard Project

## Project Overview
This Weather Dashboard is a lightweight, responsive web application that fetches and displays real-time weather information from the OpenWeatherMap API. Built with HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS, it provides users with a clean interface to search for weather conditions in any city worldwide.

## Key Features
- **City-based Weather Search**: Users can enter any city name to retrieve current weather data
- **Real-time Data**: Connects to OpenWeatherMap API for up-to-date information
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices
- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean layout with intuitive controls
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear feedback when city names are invalid or when API requests fail
- **Loading States**: Visual indicators during data retrieval

## Technical Specifications
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (Tailwind), JavaScript (ES6+)
- **API Integration**: OpenWeatherMap API via Axios
- **Layout**: Mobile-first responsive design
- **Dependencies**: Tailwind CSS, Axios

## Weather Data Displayed
- City name and country
- Current weather description
- Temperature in Celsius
- Humidity percentage
- Wind speed in meters per second

## Implementation Details
The application uses modern JavaScript practices including async/await for API calls and DOM manipulation for updating the interface. The search function triggers on both button click and Enter key press for better user experience. Error handling ensures the application remains stable even when the API is unavailable or returns errors.

## Deployment Requirements
- Web server with HTML/CSS/JS support
- Internet connection for API requests
- OpenWeatherMap API key (free tier available)

## Future Enhancements
- Geolocation support for automatic local weather
- Extended forecast (5-day prediction)
- Weather icons and visual indicators
- Temperature unit toggle (Celsius/Fahrenheit)
- Search history and favorites

## Target Audience
This weather dashboard is designed for general users seeking quick, reliable weather information with minimal complexity. It's particularly suitable for travelers, commuters, and anyone who needs to check weather conditions at a glance.
